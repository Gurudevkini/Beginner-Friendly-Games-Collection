# About
This is a simple PvP snake game. A real-time game where players can compete against each other. The game is developed using Node.js and Socket.io for the backend and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend.
Currently there is only one mode, First to 10 points win. But slowly I will update it and add other modes like clock rush and so on.
